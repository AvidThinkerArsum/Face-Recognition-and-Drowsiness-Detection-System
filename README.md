# Face-Recognition-and-Drowsiness-Detection-System

Moitvation:

Using Python Libraries for my Computer Vision Interests

Libraries used are OpenCV, dliv, face_recognition, imutils, numpy, twilio

toRun - uses EAR ratio to display 'active' or 'drowsy'; also displays the 68 landmarks

second - uses EAR ratio, draws contours around eyes, sounds alarm

face_recognition - experimentation with face recognition stuff. Finding people through Images, on live, and training model to recognize person on Live

final - integrated version with initial facial recognition, followed by continuous drowsiness detection. In case of drowsy alarm is sounded, image captured and sent over email and SMS with time stamp.
